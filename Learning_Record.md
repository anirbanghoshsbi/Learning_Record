**Things I worked on :** 
1. Simple sklearn/keras code to convert categorical data to OHE.Updated in Github.
2. Worked on Counters problem on Hackerrank.com (Still have doubt).
3. Worked on Graphs , trees.
4. Watched appliedai.com explanation on bow , tfidf, countvectorizer(sklearn) and word2vec.
5. Watched the video on seq2seq chat bot model at udemy.com , asked one question awaiting reply.
6. Wrote a simple script to convert video frame to image frame using openCV+python.

**To Remember :**
1. Complete the DataAnalysis with Pandas book available in dl4cv and g drive.
2. Check for replies of queries on udemy and appliedai.com
3. Revise all these topics on 26/08/2018.

1. List Comprehension (gotm more doubts than solutions)
2. Worked on dataanalytics with Python completed till  vectorization (to do broadcasting) on datasciencewithpython.ipynb
3. Worked on linked list , arrays , queues and stacks along with binary trees and tree traversal , sorting techniques.
4. Read about transfer learning , project to code a transfer learning on real dataset.
.

**Things I worked on :** 
1. Worked on multi-class multi label Classification image classification problem (use of binary cross entropy :as one-vs-rest classification)
2. Worked on data analysis with python about array slicing.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis and base line model on credit default. Focus data preparation and feature engineering.
4. 


**To Remember :**
1.check multi-label and santa or no santa classification problem for specific correlations there also check with the chapter saving 
and loading models in keras for specific changes in implementation.
2.Revise all these topics on 29/08/2018.
