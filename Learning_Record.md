**Things I worked on :** 
1. Worked on multi-class multi label Classification image classification problem (use of binary cross entropy :as one-vs-rest classification)
2. Worked on data analysis with python about array slicing.

3. Revised all topics on 11/09/2018.Slow down on revision as I might not have a very good 
mental condition to learn or revise as of today.

**Date : 04/09/2018 Time : 22:27

**Things I worked on :**
1. Completed Linear Regression from scratch on a real world data.
2. Checked the multi-channel CNN model for sentiment analysis.

**Date : 05/09/2018 Time : 24:00

**Things I worked on :**
1. Went through a worked example of sentiment analysis.


**To Remember**: 
1. The most learning efficieny comes from solving a kaggle kernel a week.
2. Doing ML related work for 30 minutes (from scratch).
3. Working on one problem on hacker rank a day. (python)
4. Study for 30 minutes (either NLP/CV).
5. Work on a project for a certain time...

( I will implement this by today evening)...
Along with this a revision of the work being done( I have revised a lot of NLP in the last few days, 
it should now be the focus that I start CV).


**Date : 06/09/2018 Time : 23:22

**Things I worked on :**
1. Worked on Linear Regression with multiple features (non-vectorised).
2. Read about the paper "Super SloMo: High Quality Estimation of Multiple Intermediate Frames for Video Interpolation".

**To Remember**: 
1. Complete reading the paper by the weekend.
2. Come up with an implementation by this weekend (basic).
3. 30+30 : ML and python time daily for 30 minutes each.
